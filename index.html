          Kanjōzoku (カンジョ族) refers to a legendary group of Japanese street
          racers who ruled the highways of Osaka during the late 1980s to early
          2000s. Their name comes from the Kanjō Loop (環状線 &#45; Kanjō-sen),
          a circular expressway around the city where they performed high-speed
          runs at night. What made them unique wasn&#39;t just their speed — it
          was their deep passion for street racing, DIY car tuning, and
          anti-mainstream culture. Kanjōzoku cars, often modified Honda Civics,
          were lightweight, stripped down, and built purely for performance. But
          Kanjōzoku is more than racing — it&#39;s about rebellion, identity,
          and expression. These racers formed a close underground community with
          their own codes, stickers, masks, and symbols to protect their
          anonymity and represent their crews.

        <p class="history-description">
          The roots of the Kanjōzoku (カンジョ族) can be traced back to the late
          1980s, during a time when Japan's street racing scene was exploding in
          popularity. Inspired by motorsports, underground racing groups began
          forming across the country — but Osaka&#39;s Kanjōzoku stood out.
          Unlike the touge racers of mountain passes or the flashy street crews
          of Tokyo, the Kanjōzoku chose the Hanshin Expressway&#39;s Loop Line
          (環状線 - Kanjō-sen) as their battleground. <br /><br />Throughout the
          1990s and early 2000s, the Loop became infamous for midnight races and
          daring police evasions. Modified Honda Civics, known for their agility
          and front-wheel-drive stability, were the weapon of choice. These cars
          often had gutted interiors, custom-built engines, and bold graphics —
          not for show, but to survive the intensity of high-speed loop runs.
          <br /><br />As law enforcement increased surveillance and penalties,
          many Kanjō racers faded into obscurity or took their passion to the
          track. But some crews adapted, becoming even more secretive — racing
          at odd hours, using masks and fake plates, and avoiding online
          attention. This period marked the transition from open rebellion to
          underground legend.
