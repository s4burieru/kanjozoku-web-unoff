      <p class="about-description">
        Kanjozoku (カンジョ族) refers to a legendary group of Japanese street
        racers who ruled the highways of Osaka during the late 1980s to early
        2000s. Their name comes from the Kanjo Loop (環状線 &#45; Kanjō-sen), a
        circular expressway around the city where they performed high-speed runs
        at night. What made them unique wasn&#39;t just their speed — it was
        their deep passion for street racing, DIY car tuning, and
        anti-mainstream culture. Kanjozoku cars, often modified Honda Civics,
        were lightweight, stripped down, and built purely for performance. But
        Kanjozoku is more than racing — it&#39;s about rebellion, identity, and
        expression. These racers formed a close underground community with their
        own codes, stickers, masks, and symbols to protect their anonymity and
        represent their crews.
